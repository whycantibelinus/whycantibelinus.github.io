I'm David Walkup.

I used to drive trucks. Now I build recursive engines to compress the soul of data itself.

I’m the creator of **Replicant**—a modular compression engine written in Python with a roadmap toward AI evolution and natural language interface. Part tool, part theory, part open-source rebellion.

I also founded **WILLDAMNOLCORP inc.**, a retro-futurist shadow company that may or may not exist inside SCP Foundation canon.

This site is part blog, part blueprint, part transmission.

No mailing list. No cookies. No soft sells.  
Just code, thought, and whatever I dream up next.
