---**The Missing Angle Bracket That Made Me a Developer**

In 2001, I wasn’t learning to code in a classroom or through a course. I was learning it on a MySpace profile—inside a browser-based readme editor that was basically a glorified white text box with no syntax highlighting, no undo, and no mercy.

All I had was a Pentium III, Webcrawler, a Discman repeating *Something to Write Home About*, and a broken heart I tried to fix with GIF banners and autoplay tracks.

My profile became my canvas. I hand-wrote HTML with no clue what "frontend" meant. I found guides on sketchy forums that taught me how to nest tables, drop `<marquee>` tags, and embed mp3s in ways Tom never intended. I could manipulate layout and colors, hijack image upload paths, and sneak music players into sections that weren’t designed to hold code.

But the chaos... the chaos was always just one typo away.

It was always a bracket.

A single missing `>` inside a `<module>` tag, buried 600 characters deep in the markup, could destroy everything. The whole profile would break:

- Images bleeding into each other
- Text halfway off the screen
- No scroll bar
- Music player vanished
- My soul shattered

And then I’d sit there for **four straight hours**, staring into the void of monochrome code, whispering to myself:

> "Where the hell is it?"

Then I'd find it. That one bracket.
And I'd whisper:

> "You son of a bitch."

I'd add it. Hit save. Refresh.

**Boom.**

Everything reassembled. My GIFs were dancing again. My background music was playing. My teenage pain was once again elegantly framed in broken web standards.

That’s how I learned to code.
Not by writing "Hello World" in a clean editor.
Not by following a tutorial.
But by surviving.

MySpace taught me:
- How to debug without tools
- How to spot patterns in garbage code
- How to fix what I didn’t understand
- How to **never give up** when something looks broken

It taught me that one character can change everything—in code, in layout, and in life.

These days, I build cleaner systems with better tools.
But every time I open a broken config file or chase down a layout bug, I hear echoes of my old self hunched over that glowing CRT monitor, whispering...

> "Where the hell is it?"

And then fixing it.

Because I’m still that dev.
Only now, my canvas is bigger.

And I never miss a bracket twice.
