I used to drive trucks. 14 hours at a time. Dead silence, open roads, brain on fire.

I thought about a lot of things out there.

Reality. Compression. Identity. Data. God.

Now I build Replicant.

---

Replicant is an open-source compression engine written in Python. But it’s more than that.

It’s a foundation for something recursive. A system that could someday learn. Adapt. Speak.

It’s built fast. Built modular. Built real.

And it works.

---

I didn’t go to MIT. I didn’t get seed money.  
I built this because my mind doesn’t know how to stop.

And because I think there’s something fundamentally *off* about how tech is evolving—  
Ad-driven, dumbed down, afraid of weirdness.

I’m not afraid of weirdness.

This is the start.

We’re not just building a dev tool.

We’re building something **that remembers.**
